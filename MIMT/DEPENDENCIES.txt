The following files require Image Processing Toolbox to work
Many files have had IPT dependency removed by implementing conditional fallback methods
and will run with some loss of performance

DEPENDENT:
dilatemargins
driftds
glasstiles
im2ods
im2spectrogram
imdestroyer 
lcdemu
linedither
shuffle
text2spectrogram
tonemap
vectorscan

SOME DEPENDENCY:
erraccumulate ('scale' and 'rotate' operations)
imlnc (histeq methods)
imfold (when using nondefault 'scale' method)
immodify (blurs, tonemap, blue noise dither, line dither)
immask (geometric selections, morphological operations, etc)
noisedither (blue noise mode)

NO DEPENDENCY:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
some files may still require other resources:
picdynamics requires LTI simulation tools which may be found in various toolboxes
gifread/gifwrite requires imagemagick for certain options

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
ALSO consider FEX dependencies:
these should be included in the zip archive, but just in case:

colorspace() is required by csview()
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28790-colorspace-transformations

inpaint_nans() is required by thresholdinpaint()
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4551-inpaint-nans

STFT/ISTFT tools are required by im2spectrogram() and text2spectrogram
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45197-short-time-fourier-transformation--stft--with-matlab-implementation

text2im() is required by text2spectrogram()
